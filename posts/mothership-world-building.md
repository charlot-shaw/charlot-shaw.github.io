[Mothership](https://shop.tuesdayknightgames.com/collections/mothership) is a sci-fi horror survival game by Tuesday Knight Games, and it's caught my eye. Although I love my personal projects dearly,
I don't want to burn out on them, so am going to take a break from the haunted forests of Grimmswold.

The megadungeon [Gradient Descent](https://shop.tuesdayknightgames.com/collections/mothership/products/gradient-descent) impressed me quite a bit. It seems a decent setting for a meaningful campaign, and a springboard for further games if players wish and time allows.

Mothership has a distinctive feel to it, a [Cassette Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassetteFuturism) distilled from it's inspiration. I've not run a game in a setting like this, and I found myself approaching prep as if this was [LANCER](/tags/lancer.html)-style facility. To try and bring my sensibilities in line with the setting, I thought I'd worldbuild, see what constraints and ideas popup, and work from there.


### Tech

#### Communication

Computer networks are balkanized, self-contained islands managing the resources of a ship, a compound or similiar. Communication between networks does exist, but it's mostly sending emails to other users, participating in local bulletin boards, or status updates. Monetary transactions exist as well, but there's not really a credit card analog; You might have a credstick for your tab on a station, but it's unique to that station, and unlikely to be accepted by some other outstationer. 

You can, of course, entrust your credits to The Company, but any balance you leave with them is liable for repossesion over debts unpaid.
