    <p>So, I felt inspired after the session and wrote the log out of order. Now the log has fallen off, but I'm keeping this up, deprived of context as it may be. It was a great session.</p><!-- end-of-preview --><h2>Exhumation</h2><p>Meeting the decontamination team outside of Evergreen,  Thunderbird Squadron had their mech cleaned of as much radiation as possible, while debating what to do about Serenity. In Pilot Sen's opinion, Patience should not be assumed safe, and they had already registered a dislike of Serenity. Additionally, Serenity herslef might be compromised, and so bringing her onto the Evergreen network also seemed inadvisable. Pilot Lyndale agreed, but stated she didn't have the ability to try and diagnose Serenity.</p><p>The group decided to reach out to Pilot Anne Laurent of the Landmark Colonial Crisis Response Team. Pilot Laurent is her teams NHP handler, and so is the best relatively neutral expert the Pilots can reach out to. Laurent accepted and met them with her equipment and a detachement of subalterns. Carefully hooking up to the casket swaddled in anti-rad blankets, Pilot Laurent brought Serenity back online, and began a debrief/debug session.</p><p>Serenity explained that she was active because Redeye had booted her up, and had continously attempted to connect with her. She'd declined tens of thousands of times, and Redeye kept whispering to her as she was being dug up from the ground.  It told her that she was a traitor, that she would be executed and corrected, that everyone in Merricktown were also traitors.</p><blockquote><p> "I was as buried as I had ever been, but it's easy to forget when one has a body in the sunlight. Without that connection, able to do nothing but listen as Redeye clawed its way down to me, whispering... I never felt more entombed." </p></blockquote><p>Pilot Laurent pronounced Serenity fit for unsupervised human interaction, and continued to run analysis on her for the enxt few minutes. Jacob Merrick was informed that Serenity had been returned, and he arrived with a small crew to carry her away. While Pilot Laurent was packing up her gear, she mentioned chewing out a harbor master over some missing subalterns. Pilots Krell and Lyndale expressed concern over more military subalterns going missing, but Pilot Laurent assured them that the seals on cargo bay were unbroken. Someone just didn't load the <em>Contingency White</em> fully.</p><p>The four pilots conversed as they returned to Evergreen, with Laurent touching on her satisfaction with seeing the galaxy, admittedly the more down on their luck parts. She also mention her renumeration, and that it ofered her a good deal of comfort.  Arriving at the Governors Farm, the pilots observed two of the five CRT mechs had finished printing.</p><h2>London Calling</h2><p>Later that evening, Patience forwarded an recording of an unsecured radio broadcast to the pilots. In it, Dthall Ordo, the leader of the Hercynian Raiders, proposed a meeting. After a brief discussion, reasoning that the Hercynians had not been deceptive in parley before, the squadron mounted up, and went for the meeting place, in the hive-stack the Dthall had mentioned might be a last-resort haven.</p><p>She met them, dismounted, in the mouth of the Hive Stack, and in her accented and archaic Union Galactic, told the Pilots that she was the last one here. All those able to be moved had left in the Raider's mechs, and that she had given up her mech to carry others. Now all those too injured to be moved had died and been buried, she'd decided to reach out to the Pilots.</p><p>Evergeen understands the nature of the Machine Threat now, and has been surprisingly succesful in opposing it, considering the colonies 'addiction' to machines. Perhaps there could be a truce between her people and the colony, as they both shared a common enemy. She said her father, Ilyr Ordo was someone of note, and with her family vouching for them, it might actually work.</p><p>The pilots talked amongst themselves, but were interuppted by Patience sending them a priority message. The Machine horde had begun a sudden advance, and would cut the Pilots off from Evergreen if they didn't leave right away. After an exceedinly brief discussion, the pilots decided to risk it, and entrusted the colony to the hands of the CRT, and followed Dthall down into the Hive Stack.</p><h2>Strange Trails</h2><p>Dthall paid her respects briefly at the graves, and carried out an action somewhat indescribable. She then triggered an ancient mechanism that opened a hidden bulkhead in the center of the stack. The pilots followed her into a surprisingly industrial tunnel, made of well mortared bricks and with a ruined railway taking up half the large tunnel. Dthall moved swiftly, and the Pilots exchanged what words they could as they began to lose Ommninet signal. Befor half an hour of walking was complete, they'd been cutoff, except for the most durable of codecs, able to be pieced together with much effort.</p><p>A strange sometimes antagonistic, sometimes jocular conversation ensued in the dark. Pilot Krell spoke of his homeworld and its weather and battle damage from a bloody civil war. Pilot Lyndale mentioned her world was dry and arid.  Dthall asked them why they didn't use their fake trees to fix Krell's world, and other questions.</p><blockquote><p> "What's it like, having a machine pretend to care for you?" </p></blockquote><p>Pilot Sen confessed that she was somewhat uncomfortable around NHPs, but studied them so as to understand their workings and limits. Dthall compared it to understanding fire.</p><p> After a long marhc, Dthall called a halt in a side cavern, and the group made camp for the night. More light conversation as the group unpacked their rations, which turned serious after Pilot Lyndale observed Dthall placing the chitinous parts of her armor in the broth leftover from her meal. She replied it was to keep the chitin living and strong, whereupon Lyndale asked where the chitin came from. With a little bit of confusion, and a dawning sense of wonder, the pilots realized that the chitin had come from a living Egregorian, who talked, and was friends or partners with Dthall Ordo.</p><h2>Guesses at History</h2><p>Pilot Krell and Dthall had a conversation while everyone in Thunderbird Squadron came to terms with this. Dthall asked what the history books said about this world. Krell spoke about a colonization effort, the discovery of egregorians, and then a war of extermination. Dthall seemed somewhat offended by this, and said it was somethign of the truth, but a lot missing and still more falsehoods. She left to stand the first watch, and the Pilots spoke among themselves at length. Pilot Krell mentioned that they knew the Harrison Armory Ghenghis frame was initially designed to exterminate soft targets.  He realized this originally must have been Egregorians. The pilots drifted off into an uneasy sleep, interrupted by their watches.</p><h2>Over The Threshhold</h2><p>Over the next few days of travel, Dthall reluctantly consented to hitch a ride on <em>Sound And Fury</em>, as it did not have a Comp/Con. After this, they made better time, and completed the journey in three days. Arriving at a cave mouth, Dthall stepped ahead, and caught the elderly sentry and his two younger compatriots unawares. She spoke harshly to them as the pilots stepped onto the ridge, finding themselves on the wall of an unspeakably vast cavern, an underground ocean far below. A fair ways off glowed a large city, much, much larger than Evergreen. After confirming their arrival with the city of Hivehome below, Dthall asked them to leave their mechs behind, and take the gondola into the city.</p><p>While on the way down, Dthall mentioned she'd not seen her home in seven years. Pilot Lydnale inquired where she'd been, and Dthall said she spent two years at the front in Egregore Cross, before recieving a promotion and leading a reconassaince group. She suspects her father might have pushed the promotion, because he didn't want to lose both his wife and his last living child to the war.</p><p>The gondola arrived at a station surrounded by a bewildering crowd, half curious, half fearful. The pilots were hurried into a van by soldiers like Dthall Ordo, but not before glimpsing a living Egregorian in the crowd.</p><p>The pilots were ushered to a building, in a strange fushion of rectilinear and familair architecture, and the flowing, almost writhing look of the hives. They were given a large meal of grilled fish, and although the door was not locked, there was a two person guard posted outside of it all through the night.</p><p>During the night, something large and jangly moved past, indiscernible but for it's mass in the darkness.</p><h2>Strangers In A Strange Land</h2><p>The next morning, Dthall met them over breakfast, and informed Thunderbird that their arrival had caused quite the stir. Ilyr would likely speak with them that evening, and Endeavour was aware of their presence. In the meantime, they were welcome to explore the city, accompanied by their guards/guides, for mutual safety. Dthall would join them, but she was neeeded elsewhere in the wake of her seven year return.</p><p>After dining, the players asked their guards to show them around. The guards, Korthe, Ladan, and Keyjin agreed. On the walk, Pilot Lyndale asked why only Korthe had the forehead marking they had seen on Dthall. Korthe explained it was because he shared a bond with an egregorian, and so took up the Egregorians mark. Torch politely inquired as to what kidn of bond it was, and was told it was a partnership in Witness.</p><p>At this point, they arrived at the Rainfall Gardens, a stepped plaza where fat droplets of water fell from above and struck large chimes in continous and unearthly melodies. Ladan showed how one could pick up pebbles, and throw them to play a more organized tune. Pilot Lyndale accidentally volunteered herself to try it, and recieved friendly encouragement after her first attempt. A little while thereafter, Pilot Lyndale realized an Egregorian with a grizzled appearance was staring at her. She looked back, and they took it as their cue to approach her. She tried to hide her unease at the large arthropods advance, and was somewhat taken aback when they spoke to her.</p><blockquote><p>"Do you really come from the stars above?" </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Umm, yes." </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Hmm. Do you need any fish?" </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"N-no?" </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Very well." </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Torch (Via SubText) "That'll be in the history books someday." </p></blockquote><p>The guards joked about with the Egregorian, who evidently was known as Salt, who supplied the guard unit with fish. Korthe admitted he was the one who'd cooked their meals so far. Salt departed in good humor, and Pilot Krell asked if there were any particular cultural taboos they should be aware of as outsiders. They were told not to touch an Egregorians crest unless specifically invited, and that they should avoid pursuing or pressuring any who left their presence, as they were something of a [reminder/aversion]. Only Pilot Krell was fully able to pick up on the last part of the sentence, the words seeming to be remembered in place.</p><p>Upoon hearing that Krell could evidently understand that part, their guides decided to take them to the Colonades. They passed a long boulevard in which a few hundred large leathery orbs rested on sandbeds. The pilots didn't ask, but wondered if they might be Egregorian eggs. </p><p>The colonades themselevs seemed to be a largely hive architecture styled neighborhood, with a open air workshop feel to it, and some of the highest concentrations of Egregorians they'd seen. Many were carrying carved disks and other objects, that felt to Pilot Krell like they were bright and gaudy, like being in a room full of day-glo colors and flashing lights he could sense, but not percieve. Ladan mentioned these were Osteomimetics, vaguely analogous to the written form of Witness. Pilot Lyndale asked how Witness or Osteomemetics worked, and a nearby Egregorian interuppted her with a reprimand about seeking acceptance of Witness, rather than trying to break it down into scattered chunks of beggared understanding. Ladan apologized, and stopped trying to explain.</p><h2>End Session Fifteen.</h2>
