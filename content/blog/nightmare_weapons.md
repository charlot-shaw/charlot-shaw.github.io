Bloodborne has it's claws in me, and I wonder if the Hunter's vibes can be captured in an RPG.

[Grave](https://jasontocci.itch.io/grave) addition

* Weapons have two forms, and thus two transitions
    * Transition abilities
        * Special attack when transitioning
        * Buff or utility
        * Additional cost beyond stamina
    * Form abilities
        * Something about the weapon itself needs to change.
        * Reach
        * Bonus conditionals
        * Damage dice?
