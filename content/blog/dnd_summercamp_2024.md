I recently GMed the games for a D&D themed summer camp at a local school specializing in twice exceptional students.
It was a great opportunity to push my GMing skills and help out my community.
It also meant that I got to run a lot of games under both Knave and D&D 5E, and think about the differences.
Finally, I can also review the adventures I ran, and talk about how they performed under these constraints.

## Structure Of The Camp

Student's would attend Monday through Thursday, and I'd run game sessions Tuesday to Thursday, giving them a day to kick things off.
The length of sessions would vary, based on what the kids wanted to do, and how much time was taken up by other activities. 
Ideally, I wanted to run each weekly group through three oneshots, giving them a complete story to go home with each day.
Often a dungeon would take a bit, so it would become a two-shot and a one shot.

### Systems and Tools

These are the resources I drew deeply upon.

* [Knave 2E](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/484910/knave-second-edition)
* [The Monster Overhaul](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/421868/The-Monster-Overhaul)
* [Waking Of Willowby Hall](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348439/the-waking-of-willowby-hall) 
* [Trillema Adventures](https://blog.trilemma.com/search/label/adventure)
* Dungeons and Dragons 5Th edition corebooks.
* [Dungeon Dozen I & II](https://zackmorrison.itch.io/), for 5E homebrew subclasses.

On the first day with a group, I'd ask if they wanted to play with Knave or with 5E, and talk them through the choice. Knave is easier to pick and faster moving in play, whereas 5E is the one you might be more familiar with.
If we play Knave, we can do character creation and you can make your own Character, or we can do 5E and get right to the action with some pregens. 
This worked pretty well, and I think helped the kids realize that I was listening to them.

I wouldn't bring up the question if I knew there were dedicated 5E players in the group, because I didn't want them to be faced with the vote going against them.
Dungeon Dozen didn't come up too often, just one player who was hanging around in prior weeks prebuilt their character using an option from it.
There was only one other kid who showed up with a pre-built character, every other 5E group used pregens.

Normally, I would have brought up consent tools like the [X-card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/mobilebasic) in the first session.
However, between the school setting and everyone being new to each other, generally the vibe didn't work out for it on the first day.
I wanted to introduce it when there was more trust established between everyone at the table. The last thing I wanted was for it to become a meme or a source of teasing.

Picking Trillema Adventures made sense to me. I could homebrew something, (and did a few times), but I needed my focus elsewhere.
5E prep was hefty compared to Knave, and the constant swapping of groups meant I had to stay on my toes.
Recycling material helped with that, but it had it's limits.
Plus, I wanted to try out all these adventures I'd read but never played.
Willowby Hall was reserved for the groups that I felt truly gelled, and could handle a really dynamic scenario.

### Knave Versus 5E

With the choice of systems, I got a lot of insight into what got the kids excited, and what worked at the table.

#### Characters

In Knave, the kids loved the failed careers, several times asking to read through the list after random character generation was over.
(I did allow one group to pick, but there was only one copy of Knave to pass around, and it turned into a big timesink.
It was fun answering questions about the profession names meant though.) 

The random name generator was also fun.
Biggest issue was going through and doing the optional equipment, like armor and torches and rations, as it broke out of 
'roll and tell the GM, she tells you what to write down' mode, and into a bit of analysis paralysis.
People who rolled one or two HP needed reassurances that they weren't doomed, which tended to bring in slots and wounds into the discussion early.

5E had them excited for the shiny options, the way they could choose to have an animal companion or be a chaos sorceror.
In the one group I tried to do full character creation with, this foundered out as all the math and look-ups slowed them down.
I, in addition to the book, became the rate-limiting step, trying to find something I could give each kid that would last beyond me leaving to help the next.
Quite frankly, it was miserable, and my biggest fumble of the camp.

The groups running pre-generated characters didn't have much reactions, just picking out what sounded good and chatting with the others about it.

#### Complexity

The simplicity of Knave was great here, and I could day by day introduce extra rules as they came up. It felt like a proper tutorial in all honesty. 

* Day 1, we'd play with making attack, skill and defense saves, plus basic inventory management, health and damage.
* Day 2, the mages would have spells and spellbooks, and I'd start tracking time for torches, daylight or rations. 
This would bring up healing and wounds as the [adventure](#the-terrible-salt) on the second day would be over a longer timescale. Finally, I'd level them at the start.
* Day 3 would build further, bringing into play whichever I'd not focussed on prior, or if the kids didn't seem up for it, letting it ride. Another level up at the start too.

Kids could see what they needed on the Knave sheets, there being only thirteen or so numbers on it. Inventories full of shennanigan supplies also seemed to click better than a list of traits and features.
`Favored Foe: Undead` is more abstract than `Holy Symbol`, and definitely more so than `Stick With Knive On The End`.

5E was a bit of a wall. Although I made sure to prioritize things like precomputed attacks and common spells on the character sheet, there was so much density to it.
Kids would look for Initiative under skills, or add the stat and not the modifier to rolls. There wasn't a great fallback option, like [Lumpley Games discusses in Apocalypse World](https://lumpley.games/2019/12/30/powered-by-the-apocalypse-part-1/). 
Sure, everything is a d20 roll, but what is added to that roll varies so much, and everything is hardcoded to 'do a d20 roll, and then something'.
I wanted to introduce mechanics day by day, but 5E was monolithic, and the three days usually was spent mastering the basics.

In short, the kids who had it as a special interest, had it, and those who did not struggled.

## Adventures
I'd like to note that this feedback is specifically for running these for kids on a tight timebudget. It's far from the usual perspective that these were designed for.

### The Sky-Blind Spire

[This adventure](https://blog.trilemma.com/2016/04/the-sky-blind-spire.html) has turned into my favorite introductory module, and I ran it for almost every group. I have a lot more to say about it as a result.
The central puzzle is simple enough to be reliably grokked, and drives exploration once it's understood. (I usually run it with most of the rooms numbered in world, especially with kids.)

I play the Giants as desperate, but willing to bargain. They are eating their winter supplies to not starve in this tower, and are willing to hail and talk to the groundlings.
They don't like sneaky stuff, but will be honest, if gruff and dismissive.

In contrast, I play the Naiad's as friendly, but manipulative. They will tell the players what they think they need to know to get the tower disarmed, and attack if anyone comes in bearing a spark. They aren't very good at lying though, so the kids can catch them out in it.

The third intelligent faction, the Ricalu Goblins, only one player group has really interacted with them. Usually they serve to stir up tension between the Giants and the groundlings, or knock the players out of inaction by threatening their stuff.

In general, I make the following modifications

* The party has been sent by a mage's college to retrieve Titardinell's research, and ensure that the tower isn't going to become an active hazard before they can get a senior adventuring team out there. (Phrasing it this way means combat is optional than if it was 'clear the tower'). Anything that isn't Titardinell's original work is up to the PCs to dispose of. (This is how my mage players get their spellbooks.)
* There's a single naiad trapped in the pit betwwen ten and eleven. She's desperate enough to let herself be bottled if that's what it takes to get her out.
* There's an enchanted bell on the altar, as well the final volume of Titardinell's notes. The bell's enchantment depends on what I'm running after this. By default, tolling it helps dreamers sleep undisturbed by nightmares or mental intrusions.
* You can walk the tower in reverse order to disarm it, rendering it safe for the lake and pleasing the Naiads.
* The size of the corridors matters. The giants are confined to their loop and the grand staircase down to the Naiad's room, they can't take route B to get there quicker. Dire pelicans can fit up the stair way to room eight, but not down the southward hall. Goblins and the young pelican can go everywhere.
* The Changeling Cone makes you Giant sized, which unnerves the Giants and makes fighting them easier. In the opposite direction, that five foot hop acrosss the pit is now a ten foot leap, and it's deeper now.
* If the tower is disenchanted too quickly and I need to add padding, I'd have a boss fight with an Elsewhere Beast from the Monster Overhaul.

There's a few downsides to the adventure that I want to mention here.
First, everyone enters the tower, I describe the skeletons overhead, and someone steps onto the floor, and gets a spark. Everything stops. 
I've had two groups independently decide this meant a fantasy-sniper-analog had drawn a bead on them, and immediately assume they're already dead.

I've worked to counter this by giving anyone with mage tendencies a description of the magic as 'mostly a marker and anchor for a larger spell.'
This helps, but having an unavoidable, minimally anounced thing visibly target them right out the gate spooks the kids.

Second, the random encounters have been lacklustre. The giants are limited in their movements (my fault), the pelican only once got to shine and wasn't trounced quickly, the goblin is by default impercievable, the fly is a curiousity, and the Giants singing is only interesting if the players haven't met the Giants yet. Every group I've ran this with in the summer camp has gone down route A, meeting the Giants first.
It's luck of the draw that no undines have been rolled, but they haven't. (Oh well, one day I'll roll them.)

### The Terrible Salt

[The Terrible Salt](https://blog.trilemma.com/2023/03/the-terrible-salt.html) is a great introduction to wilderness survival. It places the characters in a downright hellish landscape and makes them decide on paths, how much ground they think they can cover in a day, and how they're going to handle logistics.
It hits the high notes in a environment that's outside of normal enough that the default assumptions of 'sure we can find water and food' are questionend unconciously. One group butchered several monsters for food.

In order to fit in the time availible, I added a Predatory Snail from the Monster Overhaul to Wedding Rock. This allows the kids to DIY a boat if they take the Northern route. 
If they encounter Petryl early, it's an interesting choice that the Tern can suggest to them. (Petryl's name gave rise to so many Desyl or Gasolyne jokes.)

Although there's nothing sexual in the end about the Wives Of The Sea, I decided to rename them the Children or Choir Of The Sea, to get ahead of innapropriate jokes.

The Salt Lords were a lot of fun to act out physically. I've missed this aspect of RPGs with my main games being all online. The Players usually bargained with Bounties, though one group tried to [ditch a PC](#ears-guy) who was getting on other's nerves.

Finally, next time I run this, I'm pre-rolling the tides and syncing them with the Knave system of watches. Too much to roll, lookup, and mark down in the middle of narration.

### At The Hour Of Death

[At The Hour Of Death](https://blog.trilemma.com/2022/07/at-hour-of-death.html) was a bit of a mixed bag. The kids loved the Physician, and his clear disdain for them. The one group pictured a romeo-and-juliet love story between him and Sierk, and found the contrast with reality hilarious as it was revealed. However, there wasn't enough conflict inherent in the scenario to drive much engagement, and so they clung to the Physician and that prevented him from getting up to trouble to drive more conflict. 
Reaction rolls went well for the party, and the dungeon collapsed into a new mostly stable state. A player figured out the mirror before anyone really worked out the gameboard, and they played the game with Sierk.

I keep in my DM's kit a physical board and tokens for [Nine Men's Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men's_morris), as it's pretty quick to teach, I'm familiar with it enough to trounce a new player if I'm playing someone
very skilled at the game, and it can be won pretty quickly. Having a physical prop made this so much more engaging than a series of dice rolls, and I could keep GMing for the rest of the players inbetween turns, no longer sitting at the head of the table but opposite my opponent. It really shook the vibe up in a good way, and I'd recommend having something like Nine Men's Morris around in your kit.

I opted not to run this dungeon again, so that's my key takeaways.

### The Waking Of Willowby Hall

Not a Trillema Adventure this time, [The Waking Of Willowby Hall](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348439/the-waking-of-willowby-hall) is by Ben Milton, the creator of Knave.
This is a very dynamic adventure, with the Hall in question being changed by many processes during gameplay. I opted to save this one for only groups that really gelled together and 
felt cohesive enough to handle the chaos, which seems to have been the right call.

The wild goose hunt took center stage, with standoffish relations with the other adventuring crew. 
The goose hid in the random encounter tables, and was only found at the very end of two sessions of gameplay. (I was honestly going to fudge that roll if hadn't come up naturally.)
I would have liked to make a copy of the map so I could better track which rooms Bonebreaker Tom had trashed.

Despite being a 5E group, Willowby Hall had a PC fatality, a Black Dragonborne Wizard who failed to evacuate the ballista tower before Tom put a bell through it.
I gave them the option to play Apocalypse Anne for the rest of the session, which they accepted and it worked alright.
Next session, they opted to take the Bob II route, and had a otherwise identical White Dragonborne Wizard. (Gandalf the White Jokes abounded.)

At the end of the session, sprinting away from the manor, that player's dice turned on them again, and instead of having them be caught by Tom, I asked the player if I could do something instead.

> You just kind of accepted that this pale shadow of your former comrade just appeared, walked right back into the space left in the party, and now you see them smile at the rest of you, and mouth silently.
>
> "Go, be happy."
>
> And then they fade away into the mists that surround the hall.

Not sure if I killed one or two PCs in that camp, but the player loved having played their own ghost.

### The Mouth Of Spring

[The Mouth Of Spring](https://blog.trilemma.com/2019/02/the-mouth-of-spring.html) was pretty solid the one time I ran it. The main mechanic of the dungeon draining was interesting to run, although the players were cautious/distracted and let it drain out well ahead of them. This dealt with the Malak, and the players kept moving slowly. They did not opt to visit either the Pool of Disguise, despite it's cut archway standing out in the natural stone walls. They also didn't move upstream to find the Vault Oysters.

I would have hated if the players had moved in the other direction in the Malak hall, as there's almost nothing there. If this adventure were to come up again, I'd likely move the Vault Oysters to the hallway with the return path, so that there's something interesting along both paths. I'd also tweak the starfish, as the players had big digression about if something was uplifting them and the Selkis.

Once the PCs got down to the lower area, there was a lot of fun back and forth with the Selkis and Ulthis. The group sold off the remains of the Elsewhere Beast from Skyblind Spire for access to the Voidmark spell, and one of them went up back up to face the Wives(Did run them as Wives this time, without the kidnapping aspect, it's a lot less likely to have conversations go south.)


### Glimpse Across The Void
This was the first personally designed adventure I ran in the camp, after the kids requested something scarier, with a clear antagonist, and more combat. I decided to run something focussing on a single monster of moderate strength, played as tactically as I could, I gave it three random Knave spells,and it rolled Filch, Visual Illusion, and Comprehend

The scenario was that Prof. Morton saw something in his telescope, a memetic, spell-bearing pattern in the twinkling of some far and malign star[^1]. It wormed into his brain and made him cast it subconciously, summoning an avatar of it upon this world. The creature siezed him, broke out of the observatory, and was cornered in a small dorm building. The college wants the PCs to capture the beast, and retrieve Proffesor Morton.

The adventure was a huge, fraught game of cat and mouse, with the monster cornering isolated PCs, doubling back on itself, Filching weapones out of attackes hands, and creating Illusory dead ends.
It set fires, hid in closets and left the player's reeling. They very nearly killed it, but found Proffesor Morton and opted to leave before they were slain.

This was more or less the only adventure that was 'failed', but the players had fun, though I think I could have ran it better with a secondary source of conflict in the dorm.

[^1] I'd thought of this rough scenario before, but GoblinPunch's [Madness of Avool](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-madness-of-avool.html) post reminded me of it again recently.


### First, Do No Harm

This was the second adventure I designed, whipping it together over a lunch break. It was heavily inspired by [Dishonored's Flooded District](https://dishonored.fandom.com/wiki/Flooded_District)

<img src="/static/img/dishonored_flooded_district.webp">

The scenario assumes that there was a major plague about four or five years back. This district got flooded out, and was turned into an isolation zone, where the poor and afflicted would be dumped, 
along with the dead. The local mages college sent someone in, to do what they could.
This healer went rogue, and made the flooded district his own domain, seeking to find a cure not just for this plague, but for all plagues to come.

In the present moment, a valued alumni, Kastrel, took a leave of mourning to put his sisters estate in order, and finds that she's investigated the flooded district for what really happened to their parents.
The alumni vanishes into the district, and the mages college wants the players to find him and bring him back.

Throwing a quick map up on the whiteboard, I used Knave's Buildings table to quickly populate the alley. 

* The Apocathery had a friendly-ish ghost, borrowed from Grimmswold.
* The Butchers held a pack of 4 Ghouls, using the 'agony or lose a move' variant from the Monster Overhaul.
* The Tavern held Eulalia, a memorial-keeper of the flooded district.
* A Shrine off of one street would provide sanctuary from the Nightmare Beast.
* The Brewery held the ghostly Necromancer, and all his shackled beds.
* The buildings had plank bridges connecting their second floors.

I tracked the time into the night, having a set of escalating dungeon shifts.

1. The fog rises, visibility goes down hard.
2. The dead bodies preserved under the water start to stir.
3. A screaming howl from the water front.
4. A Nightmare Beast emerges and prowls the streets for intruders.

Listing this out, it's wonderful how much things just snapped together. Knave and The Monster Overhaul are creative powerhouses.
The kids loved it, they were one of the more mature groups and they appreciated a darker tone. They drove off a siege from the ghouls, defeated the Nightmare Beast, and put down the Necromancer.

> "Don't you know that laughter is the best medicine?"
>
> Cold, dark lenses turn to face you, and the Doctor's voice lurches out.
> "Factually Incorrect!"
>
> Roll for initiative.


## Lessons Learned

Overall, GMing for the camp was a blast. It got me back into physical play, exercised a wide variety of skills, and improved my GMing abilities.
None of the games were perfect, and I had some kids who didn't mesh with their group, me or TTRPGs in general.
This hobby isn't universal, and I only have so much time in an event like this, so I'll take what I've learned and apply it moving forward.


### Riding Along or Left Behind 
First lesson, learn to spot the difference between someone who's having fun being on the periphery, and someone who's struggling with engagement.
In a longer term setting, you can coax the first towards greater engagement, in here I'd throw an event or so their way and follow the energy they gave me back.
In the second case, I try and weave more suggestions into my questions to them, laying out distinct options they can take, to help break through analysis paralysis. 
If possible, I see if I can buddy them up with someone who gets the rules or scenario more.

### Ears Guy
Second lesson, figuring out the players who are happy to betray or attack other party members, or do disruptive things as their character.
I don't blame them, TTRPGs are a slower paced medium, and the conversational nature makes jokes all too easy to turn into actions.
Add not knowing if the game's payout is worth their time, and having the natural ebb and flow of attention and action, and it's easy to see why a 
kid would do things like try to cook and eat their character's ears[^2].

Normally, I'd let the in-game consequences roll through, and keep the gameworld's logic intact. I couldn't do that very often here, because it embroils
the rest of the party in their sidequest. If four out of five are keen on exploring the dungeon, ears guy doing it again is a jarring distraction that eats into
precious gametime. If consequences get serious for everyone because of ears guy, that can make the mood turn against ears guy's player, turning them defensive, and driving the spiral deeper.

Several times the kids resolved this between themselves, which was great to see, but the other half the time, I stepped in early and asked the kids in question
about what they wanted from the game, and about what others at the table wanted.
It can bring the mood down, but it's your responsibility to drop the mood than let it spiral to rock bottom.

Of note, a few times the players tried to invoke the use of the X-Card to resolve it, which I'm of two minds on. I like that they used the tool, and it gave them
structured dialog to negotiate with. On the flipside, I don't want the X-Card to become something used adversarially. I'll be thinking on this.

In the camp setup, there's no session zero to align players, they don't know the other faces around the table, thrown together by scheduling.
This is the reality for these games, but it makes this pop up more often.

[^2] Ears guy was far from the only one of these players, but is one of the easier to reference.

### Rules In Your Head Versus At The Table
Second lesson, 5E is really meh for these rapidfire games. There's a lot of bells and whistles on everything, and kids don't have the time to parse the social
cues around them, the in-game narrative, the rules and their character section of the rules. Knave sessions ran so much better.
Admittedly, I've not GMed 5E in four years, but this is also my personal observation.

I worried I'd end up running an OSR game in my head, and just saying 5E keywords to my players, a shallow mask over a different system.
In the end, I kinda did, but it wasn't that bad, and seams didn't show on the small-scale sessions. 
The charade would falter with longer term campaigns and balancing, but it's fine here. The act of maintaining the translation wasn't even that hard.
Grab whatever GM facing OSRisms you want, it's not like 5E has much to contradict you.

### Physical Props for Physical Games
Third Lesson, Physical props and aids help.
Not counting the Nine Men's Morris board, I also handed out Knave players little red glass cabochons for their hitpoints. For the kids, it was something to fidget with that kept them in the game,
from my perspective, I could glance around and count HP visually. 
Similarly, I gave frosted glass ones to spell casters, for their spells per day. 
(If you do this, make sure they aren't spray painted. I now have frosted pink cabochons, and distressed red ones.)

For dice, I had a big pile of them in the middle of the table, where everyone could reach it. 
I'd try and keep a set in a row in front of me, so I could point and say "The d12 is one of these guys."
Ultimately, I think having a set of colorcoded dice would be great, so I can say "roll me three green dice.", and skip the geometry vocab.
That's a far-off plan, unless I get lucky on Amazon or something.

I'd considered making little slips of paper with items written on them, and having players bulldog clip them to their characters sheets. Generally, by the end of the third day,
the inventory pages would be thoroughly smudged up from all the item transfers. Don't know if this is worth the logistics when I'm storing character sheets and handing out items.

Another option would be laminating the sheets for dry erase. 
I'll probably do a few sheets like this for a portable GMs kit, but taking your character sheet home as a souvenir doesn't work with this.


## In Conclusion

I loved running these games, and on a personal note, the kids are alright. Only one or two issues over a whole summer camp was an incredibly smooth experience.
Despite the short sessions, I could feel the distinction between me playing a male NPC and being misgendered. It's a subtle difference, but crucial, and made this so much better for me.
I learned a lot, and refined how I'm going to be running Knave and introducing others to it. 

There's nothing like teaching a system to learn it.
