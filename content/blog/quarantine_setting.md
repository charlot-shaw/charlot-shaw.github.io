## Quarantine Zones

I've been thinking about settings and what makes a good sandbox, and came to some realizations about quarantine zones.
They feel like a very good fit for the OSR. 
As an instigation, something became a major problem. From there, the Authorities of the area decided that it's not fixable, 
and that the only way forward is through containment. Maybe what's inside will end with time, maybe it won't.
A Cordon has been created, physically, magically, culturally or otherwise, isolating the Problem. 

We have four sides here already, with interesting interplay. the Problem, the Authority, the Cordon, and the Outside.
This feels like the [Aesthetics of Ruin](https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/09/osr-aesthetics-of-ruin.html), writ small.
A bordered excision from a different age, with something off at it's core. 
As a prompt, it's got an opening in the Cordon, two layers minimum in the Zone, and an instigatory Problem, 
from the remains of Patient Zero to a blackened summoning circle.


### The Cordon
From the outside in, let's look at the Cordon.

It's a large scale undertaking to prevent the problem from spreading. 
On the outside, it has to deal with justifying it's continued existence.
(People tend to teardown safeguard because they're working, sadly.)

If it's still actively guarded, then it can host several factions, listing off a few ideas:

* The initial guards, who watched their empire collapse, staying at their posts.
* A group who live in the fortifications, not knowing of the (slumbering? absent?) danger.
* A set of replacement guards, who've seen the Problem and have retaken abandoned positions.
* The Cordon has been overrun, and only the structures themselves provide havens.
* Worshippers or exploiters of the Problem, guarding it as a resource.

All of these factions are readily supported, and adding in individuals working at cross-purposes spices things up further. 
This is especially true with any Problem that could spread from an individual breach, which adds a lot of tension.


### The Zone
Taking a step inwards now, we have the Zone. This once belonged to the Authority, but has been cut off.
The past has diverged from the Outside's history, influenced by isolation and the Problem. 
Playing the past and the Problem off each other is another aspect of the Aesthetics of Ruin.

Think of all the post-apocalyptic media that shows incongrously untouched items or buildings amidst the decay.
This is a great canvas for environmental storytelling, as independent vignettes build up a cohesive impression and a history of the Zone.

Something especially interesting, is seeing the Past unupdated. If the Authority is still present on the outside, then the Zone has captured
a slice of that time period. Beyond hints about how the Authority actually approached the Problem, you can also see what the Authority was doing then.
*Half Life: Alyx* has so much storytelling about how the Combine subjugated earth embedded in it's Quarantine Zone.
Similarly, *Dishonored*'s Flooded District tells a story of how Dunwall initially faltered, and continues to fail under the Rat Plague.

If a lot of time has passed, it's entirely possible that the Authority is long buried in ruins, only preserved in the Quarantine Zone.

### The Problem

What drives the Zone is the Problem; Something that the Authority couldn't stand.

The weirder that core is, the closer the whole area becomes to an [OSR-Style Challenge](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html), 
with a crucial weirdness winding through everything.



Although it might involve walls or other barriers, it is also likely composed of mortals, which turns it from a piece of terrain to something much more interactable.
A Cordon can have factions, it can have corrupt members, it can have people working solely for the greater good, and those trying to exploit the Problem for personal gain.


* The Zone Itself
    * Something specifically bad or unwanted is happening here.
    * The mundane is frozen at the time of it being sealed off.
    * The weird has had time to grow, and a new normal is being established.
    * It is contained, even if not perfectly. It's isolated, and thus sandboxable.
    * It's the [aesthetics of ruin](https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/09/osr-aesthetics-of-ruin.html), writ small.
    * The Quarantine is also an interface of mortals attempting to deal with something bigger than themselves.
    * It holds many interesting moral balancing points about the individual versus the collective (or at least the Institutional).
    * Hell, getting something good out of an ambiguous, complex situation is pretty much the epitome of OSR style problems.
* The Weirdness
    * How does it affect the players?
        * Marks them. It's clear that they've been inside.
        * Places a timer. There's something irreversible building up. Time pressure ensues.
        * Alters them. Weird powers, forbidden knowledge, mutation tables, or any of the previous two.
        * Constrains them. If the PCs broke quarantine, how bad would it be? Are they dependent on the weird?
    * How does it affect the world inside?
        * Monsters! Quite likely it's gonna induce monsters and dungeonish lairs.
        * Trade. Is there supplies from the outside, or is the economy purely internal?
        * Power. Aside from the Authority that imposed the quarantine, who else weilds power around here?
    * How does it affect the outside world?
        * Loss. Some space has been carved away, it's benefits sequestered as maintenance of the barriers induces change.
        * Study. Is anyone studying the inside? Do they look for a cure, a preventative, or a way to employ the weird?
        * Justification. Something's gone wrong, who's left holding the buck? The Authority might weild power beyond the walls, or it might be at odds with the power structure of the wider world.
* Examples
    * The Quarantine Zone, from *Half Life: Alyx*.
    * The Drowned District, from *Dishonored*.
    * The Shimmer, from *Anhilation*.
    * Talos-1, from *Prey*.
    * Cloudbank, from *Gradient Descent*.
    * Yharnam, from *Bloodborne*.
