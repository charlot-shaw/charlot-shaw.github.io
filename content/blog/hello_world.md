## Hello
I'm about average height, I have shoulder length brown hair, eyes I'm told are hazel, a thin build and flat feet. On average, I'll be in a green t-shirt, jeans and maybe a flannel, probably rather rumpled. I go by They/Them/Their, and answer to Charlot.

## World
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota Morris. I write code, fiction, games, and many other things. I practice Capoeira, juggle and camp. I like learning languages, presently working on Spanish, Clojure and Esperanto.

## !
I've done fine without an online presence before, so starting one up now has a few definite purposes.
* I want to build a site myself, or at least the front end for it. I think that keeping my content in Jekyll will allow me a fair amount of flexibility if I want to migrate in future.
* I would like a more permanent place than a mastodon feed to display my thoughts. I tend to make things, and microblogging, while fun, isn't a good fit for that.
* Being able to put up some of my work, and get attention or critique would be good. A comment system is definitely on the radar.
* It also seems fun to be more public facing, and try and give back to a chunk of the communities and tools I use, with tutorials and guides.


I think that's about all from me for the moment. I look forward to seeing where this goes.
