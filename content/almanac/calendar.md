## Spring

Spring wakes the Wold slowly, drawing life up from mucky snowpack and swaddling it in fogs and gentle rainstorms.

### Hearthfast

### Greenbreath

#### Closeholding

*20th of Greenbreath.*

A celebration of the family and home. Children acknowledge their parents labors, and parents share their pride in their children. Spouses reaffirm the qualities they treasure in their partner(s).

### Rainwrack

#### Ellyis' Dance

*8th of Rainwrack.*

A celebration of children, youth and beauty. Many begin courtships or anounce engagements here, or simply dance and sing amidst the full bloom of spring verging into summer. There can be an air of pageantry, especially in areas with stronger Brellish influence.


## Summer

Summer's heat is blunted by the shade of the Cairnsrach mountains.

### Wildease

#### Strayfate Festival
*3rd of Wildease*

A traditional day for hunting, gambling and other games of fate and fortune. It's everybodies lucky day.

#### Pact Day

*17th of Wildease*

The anniversary of the [Ghalstrae Pact](@/almanac/holds.md#ghalstrae-pact), and usually celebrated by the Brellish. Those of the Wold usually dislike it, depending on their personal politics.

### Sunreign

#### Allsalve's Day
*22nd of Sunreign*

A celebration of health, of healers, midwives, alchemists and similar, who care for the body. Scars are left unhidden, those who are recovering from long term ailments are honored at the small, private parties traditionally thrown.

### Harvestripe


#### Cloak Of The Sky
*30th of Sunreign*

Legend has it that a young girl bargained for the end of an eternal summer with the King of the Elves, who wanted to see only what was green and beautiful, even as the earth fell to dust below his garden's roots. He remained unmoved, but granted her a token for her passion. A magic cloak to break the dusty winds that were blowing down from the Cairnsrach mountains. She captured the breeze in it's folds, picked loose it's threads and flew it into the sky as a kite, where it became the storms marking the end of summer, and giving the earth the shade it needed.

## Fall

Fall is brisk and lingering, veering towards the storms of winter abruptly.

### Rattlewind

### Barebranch

### Downfall

## Winter

Winter is deep and all-encompassing, the winds off the Cairnsrach bearing the frigid fury of the Elflands beyond.

### Stormhaunt

### Brightfrost

### Firedeep
