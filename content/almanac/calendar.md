## Spring

Spring wakes the Wold slowly, drawing life up from mucky snowpack and swaddling it in fogs and gentle rainstorms.

### Hearthfast

### Greenbreath

#### Closeholding

*20th of Greenbreath.*

A celebration of the family and home. Children acknowledge their parents labors, and parents share their pride in their children. Spouses reaffirm the qualities they treasure in their partner(s).

### Rainwrack

#### Ellyis' Dance

*8th of Rainwrack.*

A celebration of children, youth and beauty. Many begin courtships or anounce engagements here, or simply dance and sing amidst the full bloom of spring verging into summer. There can be an air of pageantry, especially in areas with stronger Brellish influence.


## Summer

Summer's heat is blunted by the shade of the Cairnsrach mountains.

### Wildease

#### Pact Day
