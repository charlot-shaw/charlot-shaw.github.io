## Crafting Components

Crafting components can be found as treasure, from butchering monsters, or from repurposing items. Each component provides a certian number of tags. Recipes state how many of a given tag they need to be crafted; gather components that meet those requirements and you can craft the item.

Some recipes will call for other items, from the general 'A weapon' to the specific 'Mender's Carpal Assemblages'.

Each of the following adds a +1 bonus to the check, but can only be applied once.

* Training, background, or skilled assistance.
* 50/100/200 coin.
* 1/2/4 days of prepwork and planning.

## Enchantments

Capturing a snarl of the arcane in sympathetic snares lets you wield it's power.
An item can only a single enchantment, chosen at creation.

Weapons with 'on crit' effects only have those effects if you do not perform a manuever.
Additionally, crafted and enchanted weapons still break on nat 1s.

### Ravening

* Ignis
* Mortos

When you kill a creature with this weapon, you must immediately make another attack,
even if the only valid targets are allies or yourself.


### Leeching

* Aquae
* Anima

When you crit with this weapon, you gain 1 hitpoint for each HD your target has more than your own.

### Vanishing

* Terra

You may conceal this item from casual view until it is used or you are exhuastively searched.

### Whispering

* Ventus

You may project the noise this item makes to a point you can see. You may also speak into it with the same effects, or have it dampen the items sound altogether.

### Crawling

* Ventus x2

If not secured, this item will slowly return to you, generally arriving at the end of the next watch you spend resting.
