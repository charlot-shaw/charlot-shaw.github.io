[Grimmswold](/tags/grimmswold/) is my current TTRPG project, a survival horror open-table sandbox. The Bitterwood Almanac is the house rules/slow distillation of [Knave 2E](/tags/knave) into my own game. It's also a repository of lore that would be common knowledge to the PCs.

All rules and lore presented here subject to change without notice, as neccesary for the development of Grimmswold.
